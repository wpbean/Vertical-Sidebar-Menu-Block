The ultimate WordPress menu block for responsive collapse vertical sidebar menu.

== Description ==

Vertical Sidebar Menu Block is a powerful Gutenberg block plugin that allows you to create customizable vertical menus with ease. Perfect for sidebars, navigation panels, or widget areas, this block is designed to enhance your website's user experience while maintaining full compatibility with the WordPress block editor.

Collapsible sidebar menus are an excellent way to improve your site's user experience by allowing visitors to navigate long menus in a compact, organized manner. By hiding or revealing submenu items as needed, a collapsible design saves valuable screen space, keeps navigation clean, and ensures your content remains the primary focus. This is especially useful for websites with complex or multi-level navigation structures.
